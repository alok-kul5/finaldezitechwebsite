REPOSITORY SCAN REPORT - Dezitech Engineering Website
====================================================

PROJECT TYPE: Next.js 14 App Router (already migrated)

TOP-LEVEL STRUCTURE:
- app/ directory exists with layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css
- components/ directory with new TypeScript components
- src/ directory still contains old CRA files (duplication)
- utils/ directory with lerp.ts and useParallax.ts
- lib/ directory with framerVariants.ts

ISSUES DETECTED (one per line):

1. Missing component: components/sections/ContactCTA.tsx (referenced in requirements)
2. Tailwind config missing required theme colors: --dez-bg:#07070a, --dez-surface:#0f1724, --dez-primary:#0B3D91, --dez-accent:#26c6da, --dez-muted:#94a3b8
3. Tailwind config missing spacing tokens: spacing.96 = '24rem', spacing.128 = '32rem'
4. Missing dependency: @heroicons/react (referenced in requirements)
5. AnimatedSection.tsx is client component but spec requires server wrapper with useInView (currently has 'use client')
6. Missing content-line animations: horizontal rules with scaleX 0->1, origin-left, duration 0.42s, stagger 0.06s
7. globals.css missing grain-overlay styling
8. globals.css missing condensed font import (closest open-source match needed)
9. Hero subheadline delay incorrect: should be 0.22s (currently 0.2s in heroVariants.subhead)
10. Parallax layers missing scale transforms: should be [1.01,1.03,1.06] in addition to multipliers
11. AnimatedSection missing delayChildren: 0.06 in default variants
12. Navbar scroll threshold should be >24px (currently >40px)
13. Old src/ folder contains CRA files that may cause confusion (App.js, index.js, etc.)
14. Missing content-line component/utility for horizontal rule animations
15. ProductCard missing pill tag element (spec requires "square image, pill tag, title, summary")
16. Hero headline animation missing delayChildren in stagger config
17. All client components correctly have 'use client' directive (no server boundary violations detected)
18. No broken imports detected in new components/ structure
19. Missing styles/globals.css path (currently app/globals.css - may need to move or alias)
20. Verification.json exists but may need update after fixes

CLIENT/SERVER BOUNDARIES:
- All components using hooks correctly have 'use client' directive
- No server components incorrectly using client hooks detected

READY FOR PATCHES: Yes (after confirmation)
